# Calibration Points Configuration
# This file stores 3D world points and their corresponding image points for camera calibration
# 
# Coordinate System: X-forward, Y-leftward, Z-upward (vehicle/world frame)
# Image points are in pixel coordinates [u, v] where u is horizontal (left to right) and v is vertical (top to bottom)
#
# Point Sets:
#   - FL: Points visible in both front and left cameras
#   - FR: Points visible in both front and right cameras
#   - RL: Points visible in both rear and left cameras
#   - RR: Points visible in both rear and right cameras
#
# Minimum: 3 points per set
# Maximum: No limit (more points = better calibration accuracy)
